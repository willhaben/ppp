Progress, plans, problems (PPP) is a management technique for recurring (daily, weekly or monthly) status reporting. A person reports 3-5 achievements, goals and challenges from the reporting period. It is used in organizations in situations like employee to manager, team member to team or CEO to board, investors and advisors reporting.

Each report consists of three sections: *Progress*. Employee's accomplishments, finished items and closed tasks for the period ending. *Plans*. Goals and objectives for the next reporting period. *Problems*. Items that are stuck and canâ€™t be finished. Problems often need help from someone else, not just the employee.
